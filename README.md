# Objects and colors recognition ðŸŽ¨
### Introduction
This folder contains a high school project where the goal was to write a program that recognizes colors and objects.
The explanation document and comments in the code are in Italian since my high school studies were held in my mother tongue.
The program that recognizes colors from an image is called `rilevamento_colori_immagine.py`, while the program that recognizes the colors of an image taken from a connected webcam is called `rilevamento_colori_webcam.py`.
Lastly, the program that recognizes objects and colors is called `rilevamento_colore_oggetto.py`.
These programs were designed to be used with the aid of a PLC (Programmable Logic Computer), model S7-1512C-1 PN, and as such they can't be used without one.
